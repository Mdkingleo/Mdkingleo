    <h5>Chapter 2: <br> Questionable Action</h5>
    <p>
    Abby starts thinking about her second strange <br>dream as she’s tidying up the kitchen. <br>

    She dreamt that she was busy doing the dishes<br> when she hears a woman screaming for help.<br>
    
    Glancing out the window, she sees a short,<br> stocky man dragging something across the yard.<br>
    
    Looking a little closer Abby sees he’s<br> dragging a thin, frail woman behind him.<br>
    
    Her small, pale face is a bloody mess from <br>where he’d recently beat her.<br>
    
    Her eyes are so swollen she could barely keep them open.<br> Her golden blond hair was caked with mud and <br>
    
    clumps of dried blood. <br>Her beautiful white dress was shredded to pieces, <br>exposing her battered body. <br>
    
    As they get closer, Abby sees the man has her <br>hands and feet bound together by a rope. <br>
    
    She then notices the young woman digging <br>her bare heels in the dirt as the <br>man continued towards the fire.<br>
    
    “Please don’t do this, Jack, please! <br>I promise I’ll never try and leave you again, <br>I swear I won’t,” the woman begs.<br>
    
    “I warned you what will happen if you left me, <br>but you didn’t listen, did you?” he asks, <br>tightening his grip on the rope<br>
    
    “I’ll start listening to you! I swear I will.”<br>
    
    “It’s too late for that now!“′<br>
    
    “No Jack, please don’t do this. <br>Please let me live, please, <br>for the girl’s sake.”<br>
    
    “Your precious girls are already dead!” <br>he spat, tugging her across the yard.<br>
    
    “Please tell me you didn’t!” she tearfully cries.<br>
    
    “See for yourself.” He stops a few feet from the fire.<br> Looking over she sees her beautiful daughters <br>
    
    lying motionless, side by side in the dirt.<br>
    
    “Not the girls, not my beautiful girls,” she cries.<br>
    
    “It’s all your fault, you wretched whore,” he screams.<br>
    
    “I have to save her.” Abby thinks.<br> She tries running for the door but her <br>body refuses to move. She tried again, <br>
    
    but her feet remains firmly in place.<br>
    
    “No, stop, don’t!” Abby yells, <br>banging on the kitchen window. <br>Jack continues to pull the battered woman<br> closer to the fire. <br>
    
    Abby tries to move again, <br>but her feet remains glued to the floor.<br> Looking up, she sees a small black book fall <br>
    
    out of the lady’s pocket as he swings her into the air.<br>
    
    “Please don’t do this!” <br>The woman begs as he flings her towards the fire.<br>
    
    “Rot in Hell you wench,” <br>he yells watching the flames engulf her petite body. <br>Grabbing a child’s small lifeless body, <br>
    
    he throws it into the flames.<br> Abby sees him reaching for another <br>when Adam’s crying wakes her. <br>
    
    Thank god for Adam. Shivering, <br>she tosses the broom in the closet.”<br>
    
   <br>***************************************<br>
    
    Greg is busy working in his office when<br> he overhears two gentlemen in the hall.<br>
    
    “I heard our new manager is living <br>at the old Arnold house.”<br>
    
    “Really?”<br>
    
    “Yeah, I hope he has better luck with <br>the house than the last renters did.”<br>
    
    “Yeah, I’d hate to see what happened to <br>the last renters happen to him too.”<br>
    
    “You know what I heard?”<br>
    
    “No, what?”<br>
    
    “I heard the town folk say that none <br>of that would’ve happened if they <br>hadn’t rummaged through the barn.” <br>
    
    What are they talking about, Greg asks. <br>Jumping out of his chair, he rushes to the door.<br> Greg sees the hallway is completely empty.<br>
    
    Running to the break room, he throws the door open.<br> It was empty as well. <br>He runs back out in the hallway and <br>
    
    finds it’s completely deserted.<br>
    
    “I wonder what they’re talking about,” <br>he thinks, walking back to his office.<br>
    
    “Is everything alright?” His secretary asks, <br>seeing him step through the doorway.<br>
    
    “Did you hear what the two gentlemen said?”<br>
    
    “I can’t hear anything with my headphones on.”<br>
    
    “Do you know anything about the old Arnold house?”<br>
    
    “No, why?”<br>
    
    “I overheard someone talking about something <br>bad happening to the last renters, <br>
    
    but by the time I got to the door they’d already left.”<br>
    
    “Wait, did you say the Arnold house, the one in Urbanette?”<br>
    
    “Yeah, why do you know something about it?”<br>
    
    “I heard the last renter left because they <br>saw demons coming out of the walls.”<br>
    
    “They saw demons?”<br>
    
    “Yeah, they told everybody in town about what had happened.<br> They even asked the priest to do an exorcism.”<br>
    
    “Did he?”<br>
    
    “No, he said he didn’t believe their story,<br> none of the townsfolk did either.”<br>
    
    “Why is that?”<br>
    
    “Everyone figures the drugs made them hallucinate.”<br>
    
    “They were on drugs?”<br>
    
    “Yeah, they’re always strung out on something.”<br>
    
    “What happened to them?”<br>
    
    “They moved out in the middle of the night, <br>leaving most of their belongings behind.”<br>
    
    “That’s kind of strange, don’t you think?”<br>
    
    “Not for them it’s not.”<br>
    
    *********************************<br>
    
    Abby’s tidying up the front room when she <br>hears someone knocking on the front door.<br>
    
    “I wonder who that could be.” <br>Tossing a handful of toys in the playpen, <br>she throws the door opens. <br>
    
    Abby sees a short, <br>rounded woman standing nervously on the porch. <br>She then notices the lady is holding something in her hands.<br>
    
    “I’m your neighbor from down the road and <br>I wanted to welcome you to the neighborhood,” <br>she says, handing Abby a large chocolate cake.<br>
    
    “That’s so nice of you. Won’t you come in?”<br>
    
    “I guess it’ll be alright,<br> but I can only stay a minute.”<br> Stepping in the door, <br>the neighbor starts looking around. <br>
    
    It was like she’s expecting something to jump <br>out at her, at any given second. <br>Abby concludes, watching the young woman fidget around.<br>
    
    “Are you alright?” she asks as she <br>continues to watch the woman’s peculiar behavior.<br>
    
    “I’ve never been in the house before,” she stampers.<br>
    
    “It’s a beautiful house.”<br>
    
    “Yes, it is.” The neighbor agrees.<br>
    
    “Someone must have taken good care of it<br> for it to be in this good of shape. <br>Would you care for some coffee?”<br>
    
    “I really should be getting back,” she says, <br>turning towards the door. <br>Abby grabs her arm to stop her, the lady jump.<br>
    
    “I didn’t mean to scare you.”<br>
    
    “It’s alright.” Looking around the guest continues.<br>
    
    “I guess I could have one cup,” she says, <br>guardedly making her way to the table.<br>
    
    “Have you lived in the area long?” Abby asks, <br>grabbing the coffee from the kitchen.<br>
    
    “I’ve been here my whole life. <br>I was raised in the house I live in now.”<br>
    
    “That’s so nice. <br>Would you like cream or sugar?” Abby asks, <br>handing her a cup.<br>
    
    “No, this is fine, thanks,”<br> she says nervously taking the cup.<br> Abby watches as her fine china rattles to the table.<br>
    
    “I heard the last renters left <br>without taking anything with them.”<br>
    
    “That’s what I heard too.”<br>
    
    “You didn’t know them?”<br>
    
    “I only met them once, when they first moved in.<br> I could tell they weren’t the kind of <br>people I want to associate with, <br>
    
    so I didn’t come back,” she explains.<br>
    
    “Why kind is that?”<br>
    
    “They were into drugs and all kinds <br>of other illegal activities.”<br>
    
    “Oh, I see. I was told three little girls<br> use to live here a long time ago.”<br>
    
    “I’m not very familiar with the history of the house.<br> Taking a sip of coffee she continues.<br>
    
    “It’s best if you don’t try to find out about it either.”<br>
    
    “Why?”<br>
    
    “It’s just not a good idea to bring up the past,<br> ok. Well, I better go,” she says,<br> springing up from her chair.<br>
    
    “Stop by anytime,” Abby yells.<br>
    
    “Yeah,” she says, running out the door.<br>
    
    “I know there has to be something <br>going on with this house now,” Abby thinks,<br> watching the lady dart across the yard.<br>
    
    *********************************<br>
    
    Greg sees two employees sitting at the <br>table when he walks into the lounge.<br> Maybe they know something about the house, <br>
    
    he thinks, walking to the fridge.<br>
    
    “How do you like your new job?” <br>The older gentleman asks?<br>
    
    “Everything is going good. <br>You wouldn’t happen to know about <br>the old Arnold house would you?”<br>
    
    “Us, no, we don’t know anything, right Morris?”<br> he says, glancing over at the older man.<br>
    
    “No, we don’t know a thing.”<br> You two know something but you’re<br> too scared to share it with me.<br>
    
    Greg concludes, watching the <br>gentlemen fidget in their chairs.<br> Grabbing his lunch out of the icebox,<br>
    
    he walks towards the door. <br>Reaching the entrance way he quickly turns back around.<br>
    
    “You don’t know anyone who does, do you?” he asks. <br>The two jump in their seats.<br>
    
    “No, I don’t know a soul. What about you, Morris?”<br>
    
    “I can’t think of a soul.”<br>
    
    “Ok, thanks,” Greg says, stepping into the hallway.<br>
    
    “I hope he doesn’t go snooping around like the others, Morris.”<br>
    
    “Yeah, me either.” The older man agrees.<br>
    
    ***
    
    Abby’s busy picking up the toy room when she hears<br> her daughter yelling from the top of the landing.<br>
    
    Dropping the toys on the table, <br>she dashes up the stairs.<br>
    
    “What is it, honey?”<br>
    
    “Somebody is crying in the attic, mommy.”<br>
    
    “There’s no one up there, honey.”<br>
    
    “See,” Lilly says as the crying continues to get louder<br>
    
    “Stand back,” Abby orders.<br> Lilly steps back to her doorway as her Mama jerks on <br>the small piece of rope dangling from the ceiling.<br> 
    
    They hear a loud creaking noise followed <br>by a cloud of dust as the old wooden <br>stairs starts unfolding in front of them.<br>
    
    “That was like a magic trick, Mommy.<br> You had a cloud of smoke and everything.”<br>
    
    “I think you’ve been watching way<br> too much TV, child,” she laughs.<br>
    
    “Abracadabra, show me the stairs,” Lilly says, <br>pointing towards the steps.<br>
    
    “See Mommy, magic.”<br>
    
    “I want you to stay down here <br>until I make sure it’s safe.”<br>
    
    “But, Mommy.”<br>
    
    “Lilly!” she sternly replies.<br>
    
    “Oh, alright!” She reluctantly agrees, <br>crossing her arms in protest.<br> Abby slowly climbs the squeaky stairs unsure <br>
    
    what she’s going to find.<br>
    
    “Hello?” she calls out, but no one answers.<br>
    
    “Is anybody up here?” she asks, <br>taking another shaky step.<br>
    
    “I’m not going to hurt you,” Abby says,<br> slowly working her way up the stairs. <br>Stepping onto the attic floor,<br>
    
    she starts looking around. <br>Seeing a large shadow on the far wall, <br>she screams.<br>

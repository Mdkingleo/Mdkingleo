     <h5>Chapter 4: Fair Warning</h5>
     <p>
        Abby is rushing around the kitchen <br> up the basic essentials when she sees her <br>
        
        energetic three-year-old bouncing down the stairs. <br>How can you have so much energy,<br>
        
        child? she wonders, <br>watching her dart through the hallway.<br>
        
        “Are you ready to go, Lilly?”<br>
        
        “Where are we going?”<br>
        
        “We need to pick up a few <br>groceries for supper tonight.”<br>
        
        “Can I get a toy?” she asks, hopefully.<br>
        
        “Only if you’re a good girl.”<br>
        
        “I will be Mommy, I promise,” <br>she excitedly replies.<br>
        
        “Ok, I think I have everything,” Abby says,<br> trudging towards the door.<br>
        
        It was difficult to move fast with <br>the baby carrier, diaper bag, <br>
        
        and purse weighing her down. <br>I feel like I’m moving out, she thinks, <br>trudging across the floral tile.<br>
        
        “You forgot these,” <br>Grabbing the keys off the kitchen table, <br>Lilly hands them to her.<br>
        
        “I can’t get very far without them,” she laughs,<br> taking the set from the child’s hand.<br>
        
        “I think we’re ready, now,” she says, <br>going through her list one more <br>time as she opens the door. <br>
        
        Abby sees a short, pudgy character<br> standing on the top step when she turns around.<br> Screaming, she slams the wooden barrier<br>
        
        shut. Realizing what she’d just done,<br> she shamefully pulls it back open.<br> She sees the gentleman is still standing on the steps.<br>
        
        “I’m sorry if I frightened you,<br> Mrs. Jenkins,” he chuckles.<br>
        
        “It’s alright,” she says, <br>trying to regain her composure.<br>
        
        “My name is Randy. I’m Mr. Jones’s handyman. <br>He wants me to do a little yard work <br>for you today if that’s alright?”<br>  
        
        “That’ll be fine, Randy.”<br>
        
        “I won’t be disturbing you, will I?”<br> he replies in a slow, southern drawl.<br>
        
        “No, no, we’ll probably be in town most of<br> the day so do what you need to do.”<br>
        
        “Well, you have fun, drive safe,” he smiles<br>, walking back down the steps. Shivering, <br>
        
        Abby grabs Lilly’s hand and leads her towards the van.<br>
        
        “What’s wrong mommy?” the child asks,<br> letting go of her mom’s trembling hand.<br>
        
        “I just got a little spooked,” she says,<br> buckling Adam in his car seat.<br> Looking around, Abby sees Randy pulling <br>
        
        a lawnmower out of his pick-up.<br> There’s something about him, <br>I just don’t like, she thinks, <br>
        
        watching him lower the equipment to the ground.<br>

        “Can we go now, Mommy,” Lilly asks.<br> Startled Abby jumps backward.<br>
        
        “Yes, let go,” she says,<br> watching the suspicious looking character<br> as she closes the van door. <br>
        
        Lilly looks over to where she’s starring.<br>
        
        “He seems nice, Mommy.”<br>
        
        “Yeah, well I don’t want you around him.”<br>
        
        “Why?”<br>
        
        “I just don’t, alright.”<br> Eyeing him one last time <br>she pulls out of the drive.<br>
        
        ********************<br>
        
        Greg is walking down the hallway<br> whistling a merry tune.<br> He’s happy that things are going so well.<br>
        
        “Cushy job, nice office with my own personal <br>secretary what can be better than that. <br>The people I work with are so nice, <br>
        
        so eager to help.<br> Something you don’t find in a big city.<br> I think I’ve made the right choice after all,<br>
        
         he concludes, stepping<br> through the office door.<br>
        
        “Is everything alright at <br>the house,” Mary asks,<br> as he walks through the entryway.<br>
        
        “Everything is fine,” he replies.<br>
        
        “I’m glad.”<br>
        
        “You know a lot of people have<br> been asking me that today,”<br> he says, walking towards his desk.<br>
        
        “We just want to make sure you’re<br> settling in alright,” she stampers.<br>
        
        “There’s more to it than that.<br> Seeing her nervously straightening her desk,<br> he decides to push a little further.<br>
        
        “I want to know what’s going on and I want <br>to know right now,” he demands,<br> slamming his fist on the desk.<br> Startled, Mary jumps back.<br>
        
        “I... I... I told you about the<br> last renters seeing demons.”<br>
        
        “Yeah, and you also said no one believes them.”<br>
        
        “We didn’t, but other people claim they hear<br> strange noises when they visit the house,<br> and we want to make sure it’s not <br>
        
        happening to you too.”<br>
        
        “Is that it? You guys think the house <br>is haunted or something,” he chuckles.<br>
        
        “Something like that. <br>If something does happen or you decide<br> to move out for other reasons I have a realtor<br>
        
        friend who’d be glad to help you find a place.”<br>
        
        “I am a little concerned about the heating <br>costs since it is such a big house.”<br>
        
        “I’m sure my friend can<br> find you something a little smaller. <br>Maybe something closer to town,” she suggests.<br>
        
        “Let me talk to my wife, <br>see what she thinks.”<br>
        
        “You know I saw an adorable<br> little three bedroom brick home for<br> rent on my way to work this morning.”<br>
        
        “I’ll let you know what we decide.”<br>
        
        “You better make it quick,<br> because I doubt this cute little<br> house will be empty for long.”<br>
        
        “I’ll ask her tonight.”<br>
        
        “It may be too late by then.<br> So why don’t you ask her right now,”<br> she says, handing him the receiver.<br>
        
        “You want me to rent this house<br> awful bad, don’t you?”<br>
        
        “I just want you and your family to be happy. <br>There’s nothing wrong with that, is there?”<br>
        
        “No, I guess not. Ok, I’ll call her.”<br>

        “You won’t be sorry.”<br>
        
        *********************<br>
        
        “We’re here,” Abby announces pulling<br>into a parking space.<br> Unbuckling her car seat,<br> Lilly hops out of the van.<br>
        
        “This is a funny looking grocery store, Mommy,”<br> Lilly says, staring at the red<br> brick building in front of her.<br>
        
        “That’s because it’s a library, you silly girl.”<br>
        
        “It’s a library?” the child questions.<br>
        
        “Yeah, I want to check out a<br> few books for us to read.”<br>
        
        “Books like Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty?”<br>
        
        “Exactly.”<br>
        
        I want to pick them out.<br> I want to pick them out,”<br> Lilly says, running towards the building.<br>
        
        “Wait for me, Lilly!” Abby yells, dashing<br> across the parking lot after her. Reaching down,<br> she grabs the young girl’s hand.<br>
        
        “Don’t you ever do that to me again, alright?”<br> she scolds. The child starts crying.<br> Squatting down next to her,<br> Abby quickly explains.<br>
        
        “You could’ve been kidnapped or worse,” <br>she says pointing towards the traffic.<br>
        
        “I’m sorry, Mommy,” the child blubbers<br> through her tears.
        
        “Don’t you ever do that again, alright.”<br>
        
        “I won’t Mommy, I promise.”<br>
        
        “Dry your eyes so we can go inside<br> and remember no more running <br>across the parking lot.”<br>
        
        “Yes, mommy,” she says, <br>wiping off her chubby cheeks.<br>
        
        Stepping into the library, the young child <br>sees rows and rows of books.<br> More than she can possibly<br> read in her entire lifetime.<br>
        
        “Wow!” The child cries in delight,<br> quickly scanning the room.<br>
        
        “What do you think, Lilly?”<br>
        
        “This is cool, Mommy,” she exclaims,<br> as she continues looking around the bright,<br> colorful area.
        
        “Can I help you find something?” The <br>librarian asks as the trio steps through the door.<br>
        
        “I think my daughter found what<br> she’s looking for,” she laughs, watching<br> Lilly quickly skim through a row of books.<br>
        
        “Oh, what an adorable baby you have there.” <br>The librarian gushes.<br>
        
        “Thank you.”<br>
        
        “How old is he?”<br>
        
        “Adam will be two months tomorrow.”<br>
        
        “Babies are so precious,” The librarian <br>says, watching the infant sleep in his car seat.<br>
        
        “Yes, they are,” Abby agrees,<br> gazing lovingly at her son.<br>
        
        “You know you can help me with something<br>, after all, Janet I’d like to find out<br> about a family who used to live in the<br> house before us.”
        
        “Do you have a name?” The <br>librarian asks, walking towards a computer.<br>
        
        “Yes, it’s Arnold, Jack and Suzanne Arnold.”<br> Hearing the name Janet quickly looks up.<br>
        
        “Why do you want to know about them for?”<br>
        
        “I’d like to know if they have any children.<br> Noticing the inquisitive glance, <br>Abby continues.
        
        “See I’ve found their mother’s diary <br>and a few other personal belongings in the attic<br> and I wanted to give it back to them.”<br>
        
        “No one has seen Suzanne or<br> the three girls
        
        “Rumor has it she ran off<br> with another man, took the girls with her.<br> I’m surprised she didn’t leave sooner,<br> the way Jack treated her.”<br>
        
        “What happened to Jack Arnold?”<br>
        
        “He hung himself in the barn right<br> after his wife disappeared.”<br>
        
        “Mommy, Mommy I found two princess books,” <br>Lilly yells, running towards her mother.<br> Seeing everyone staring at her, Abby<br> quickly bends down.
        
        “We have to be<br> quiet in the library,” she whispers.<br>
        
        “Ok mommy. Can I take these home,”<br> the child quietly replies.<br>
        
        “I’d like to check out these books,<br> please,” she says, handing them to the librarian.<br>
        
        “Do you have a library card?”<br>
        
        “No.”<br>
        
        “That’s not a problem.” Reaching<br> under the desk the librarian<br> pulls out a form.<br>
        
        “Let me know when you’re finished.” <br>Walking into her office, Janet<br> closes the door.
        
        “I need to warn them<br> about her,” the librarian thinks.<br> Scooping up the phone she dials<br> a number.
        
        Putting it on speaker,<br> she started recording the call.<br> She figures the tapes will keep her out of jail <br>
        
        if the situation ever goes sideways.<br>
        
        “Hello, its Janet from the library.<br> Mr. Jones’s new tenants came in a few minutes <br>ago and started asking about the Arnold family.”<br>
        
        “What did you tell her, Janet?”<br> The gentleman questions.<br>
        
        “That she ran away and he committed suicide.”<br>
        
        “Did she believe you?”<br>
        
        “I think so.”<br>
        
        “So what’s the problem?”<br>
        
        “She has Suzanne’s diary and<br> I’m afraid something incriminating might be in it.”<br>
        
        “I’ll take care of it.” he sighs,<br> hanging up the phone.<br>
        
        ************************<br>
        
        On the way home, Abby starts thinking about<br> what the librarian had said. Suzanne<br> wouldn’t run off with another man.<br>
        
        She’s too afraid of what Jack will<br> do to her if she did. Why did the librarian<br> lie to me? Maybe she didn’t purposely lie.<br>
        
        Maybe the police assume she<br> ran away when they didn’t find her or the girls.<br> If so, would they assume Jack hung himself too?<br>
        
        Could his death actually be the<br> result of southern justice? That’d explain why<br> everyone’s being so secretive. I bet <br>
        
        they are and I bet that’s why the<br> neighbor said I’d be better off not knowing.<br> She’s warning me to leave it alone.<br>
        
        Did the last tenants figure it out <br>and that’s why they suddenly disappeared? I think<br> I’ll see what I can find out about the <br>
        
        last renters and about Jack’s death,<br> she concludes, pulling up to the house.<br> Getting out of the van she sees the back<br>
        
        door standing wide open.<br>
        
        “I bet Mr. Jones went in to check on something,” <br>Looking around she realizes his truck is<br> nowhere in sight. Maybe he forgot to<br>
        
        close it when he left. She starts to <br>get the kids out of the van when another<br> thought occurs to her.
        
        “What if we’re being robbed and<br> what if the robber is still inside?”<br>

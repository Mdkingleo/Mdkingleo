   <h5>Chapter 1:<br> The Evil Begins</h5>
   <p>
    “The house is beautiful honey,” <br> Abby exclaims as they pull into the driveway. <br>
    
    It was an older two-story farm house <br>sitting on the outskirts of town.<br>
    
    Its antique white paint and black <br>shudders gave it an old southern appearance.<br>

    The tall oak trees and the stunning<br> flower beds added to the gorgeous picturesque.<br>

    “Wait until you see the inside.”<br> Smiling, Greg turns off the van.<br>
    
    “Oh look Lilly, a swing set, and a sandbox.”<br>
    
    “I wanna see, I wanna see,” the three-year-old <br>exclaims. Throwing the van door open, <br>

    the preschooler rushes across the spacious yard.<br>
    
    “Stay where we can see you,” Abby replies,<br> climbing out of the car.
    
    “I will, mommy,” <br>the child yells, racing towards the swings.<br>
    
    “I can’t believe you got this so cheap.”<br> Stepping into the kitchen, Abby starts looking<br> around.
    
    “Do you like it?”<br>
    
    “I love it, Greg. “ She says, running<br> her hand over the handcrafted wood.<br>

    Older houses have so such charm.<br>She thinks as she continues to survey her surroundings.<br>
    
    “I was told the cabinets are specially ordered.”<br>
    
    “They’re gorgeous,” she says, running<br> her hand across the dark mahogany wood.<br>

    Seeing a smaller door off of the kitchen, <br>she excitedly runs through it.<br>
    
    “The pantry is huge, and look at this <br>beautiful china cabinet,” she exclaims,<br>

    eyeing the Victorian hutch in front of her.<br>
    
    “One room is almost the size of our entire<br> apartment,” she continues, 

    admiring the beautiful <br>furnishings. Looking to her left she <br>notices a built-in shelf
   
    with bull’s eyes <br>sitting on either side. A similar shelf <br>is directly across from it.
    
    “That’ll be <br>perfect for my antiques,” she says, <br>walking into the front room.
    
    “What antiques?”<br>
    
    “The ones I plan to collect while we’re here,”<br> she laughs.
    
    “The front room is huge, <br>and look at that beautiful view.” She <br>pulls the lacy curtains

    back to get a better look. <br>She sees the window overlooks the green mountain side. <br>She then notices

    the clear light blue skies as <br>far as the eye can see. I can gaze at this for hours,<br> she dreamily thinks.
    
    “Wait until you see the bedrooms.”<br>
    
    “How many are there?”<br>
    
    “There are three upstairs and one downstairs, <br>but these two rooms can be made into bedrooms if<br>

    you don’t want to travel the stairs,”<br> he says, points to the two smaller adjoining rooms. <br>Looking 

    around he sees his wife has completely <br>disappeared.
    
    “Where did you go?” He laughs.<br>
    
    “Up here,” she yells from the top of the stairs. <br>Greg starts to follow her up when he hears Lilly’s<br>

    high-pitched screams. Darting out the back door,<br> Greg sees Lilly standing in front of the garage,<br>

    screaming at the top of her lungs. He sees her <br>little body trembling as she stands frozen in the entryway.<br>
    
    “What’s wrong honey?” he asks, bending down next to her.<br>
    
    “I saw him, daddy, I saw him,” she yells, pointing<br> towards the garage.
    
    “Who did you see, honey?”<br>
    
    “I saw an ugly old man hanging from the ceiling,”<br> she cries turning towards her father,<br>

    she burries her head in his chest.<br> Greg scoops the terrified child into his arms.<br>
    
    “It’s alright honey.” He soothingly replies<br>
    
    “I saw him, daddy, I really saw him,” she cries.<br>
    
    “He’s not there now, see.” Hanging tightly onto <br>her father, Lilly slowly turns around.<br>
    
    “He was there, Daddy, I swear he was,” she cries.<br>
    
    “I believe you, honey,” he says, gently rubbing her back.<br>
    
    “Is Lilly alright?” Abby asks, rocking the baby in her arms.<br>
    
    “She’s saying that she saw something.”<br>
    
    “I did Mommy, I did! I saw a man hanging from the roof,” <br>she says, burying her head into
   
    her Daddy’s large shoulders. <br>Not sure what to believe, Abby glances at her husband.<br>
    
    “He’s gone by the time I got here.”<br>
    
    “Maybe she saw a shadow.” Abby suggests.<br>
    
    “I know what I saw, mommy.<br>

    I saw a fat ugly man hanging from the roof,”<br> she cries, clinging onto her father tighter.<br>
    
    “Why don’t we pick out your new room, Lilly? <br>I heard there’s a princess room upstairs,” he says,<br>

    carrying the child towards the house.<br>
    
    “A princess room just for me?”<br>
    
    “Is that the one you want?”<br>
    
    “It is Daddy, It really is.”<br>
    
    “Let’s go see if we can find it, then,” <br>he laughs as he continues across the lawn.<br>
    
    Stepping closer to the building, Abby nervously peeks inside.<br>
    
    “There’s nothing in here, but old junk,”<br> she says. Stepping through the large wooden doors,<br>

    she starts looking around.<br>
    
    “Someone left a lot of their stuff behind.<br> Nice stuff too,” she thinks examining a couple<br>

    of pieces. Laying them down, she starts<br> walking towards the back of the shed. A cold<br> 

    eerie feeling starts creeping up on her<br> the further back she went. Unable to stand the<br>

    frightening feeling any longer, <br>she rushes into the warm afternoon sun.<br>
    
    “I guess the place has all of us a little spooked,”<br> she laughs, closing the doors behind her.<br>
    
    She sees her husband surfing through channels <br>when she walks in the house. Feeling the baby<br>

    fussing in her arms, she plops down on<br> the couch beside him.
    
    “He acts like I’m<br> starving him to death,” she laughs,<br> watching Adam hungrily latch on to her breast.<br>
    
    “I want a booby too, mommy,” <br>Greg says, reaching for her.<br>
    
    “Is that all you think about?” she asks,<br> playfully slapping his hand away.<br>
    
    “With a beautiful woman showing me her breasts <br>all the time how can I not?” he asks, <br>reaching for her again.
    
    “You’ll get yours <br>tonight,” she laughs, slapping his hand again.<br>
    
    “Is that a promise?” he asks, raising <br>his brows.
    
    “You’re daddy’s incorrigible <br>little guy,” she laughs.
    
    “You enjoy it, too.” <br>He smiles.
    
    “Where’s Lilly?” she asks,<br> glancing around.
    
    “She’s upstairs playing.”<br>
    
    “Upstairs?”<br>
    
    “I tried talking her into staying downstairs,<br> but she insisted on the princess room.”<br>
    
    “Lilly loves her princesses. Do you <br>really think she saw something?”<br>
    
    “I didn’t see anything.”<br>
    
    “Yeah, but they say children and animals <br>can see things adults can’t.”
    
    “So <br>>ou’re thinking that the shed might be haunted?”<br>
    
    “Maybe.”<br>
    
    “Let’s just hope it’s a friendly ghost.”<br>
    
    “And he stays in the shed where he belongs.”<br> Abby quickly adds.<br>
    
   <br> ***************************<br>
    
    Abby is putting food in the pantry <br>when she hears Lilly laughing in her room.<br>
    
    “I guess Lilly found some toys to play with,” <br>she thinks, putting the rest of the groceries away.<br>

    Abby hears an older child mumbling something.<br> Lilly laughs in response. Plopping the food on the table,<br>

    she runs up the stairs. Hearing footsteps <br>scurrying down the hallway the child glances up.<br>
    
    “What’s wrong mommy?” Stepping into<br> the doorway, Abby starts looking around.<br>
    
    “Is something wrong, Mommy?” The child asks again.<br>
    
    “I wanted to see if you’d like a snack,”<br>she answers, continuing to survey the room.<br>
    
    “I’m not very hungry.”<br>
    
    “I’ll be downstairs if you change your mind.”<br>
    
    “Ok mommy.”<br> Turning, Abby slowly walks back down the hall.<br>
    
    “She wouldn’t understand,” Lilly says<br>
    
    “Adults never do,” The older child answers. <br>Abby runs back to the room. She sees Lilly sitting<br>

    in the same spot, playing with her dolls.<br>
    
    “Is something wrong mommy?”<br>
    
    “There’s no one in here with you, is there?”<br>
    
    “My friend Ashley is here.<br> She’s having a tea party with some of her babies.”<br> The child says, 

    pointing towards the corner. <br>Abby glances over at the small table. <br>She sees a doll in each of 

    the four chairs.<br> A small teacup is sitting in front of them.<br> Realizing she’s being ridiculous Abby laughs.<br>
    
    “If Ashley wants a snack for her party, let me know.”<br>
    
    “We will mommy.” <br>She’s having a tea party with her imaginary friend. <br>Abby laughs walking down

    stairs.<br> She then remembers the voice she heard. <br>Imaginary friends don’t make noise.<br> She thinks,

    stepping into the kitchen. <br>Greg noticed the look on Abby’s <br>face as she’s walks in the room.<br>
    
    “What’s wrong, honey?”<br>
    
    “I just heard a girl’s voice upstairs.”<br>
    
    “Lilly’s probably awake.”<br>
    
    “She is but the voice I heard wasn’t hers,<br> it was a lot deeper, one you’d 

    expect <br>to hear from an older child.” Abby explains.<br>
    
    “You know how Lilly changes the <br>tone of her voice when she’s playing.”<br>
    
    “Yeah, maybe, but how do explain all the dolls <br>being rearranged?”
    
    “Lilly probably did it.”<br>
    
    “She rearranged the ones on the top shelf too?”<br>
    
    “You’ve been working awfully hard, <br>so why don’t you lie down, take a nap.”<br>
    
    “What about Lilly and Adam?”<br>
    
    “I’ll keep an eye on the little buggers. Besides, <br>I want you rested up for tonight,” he says,<br>

    grabbing her butt as she walks past him.<br>
    
    “I knew you had an ulterior motive brewing in <br>that dirty little head of yours,” she scolds.<br>
    
    “You know me too well, honey.” he laughs.<br>
    
    Abby was out the second her head hit the pillow.<br> Within a few minutes, she started dreaming.<br>
    
    She dreamt that Lilly was playing out in the sandbox<br> when three little girls walked towards her.<br>

    She guessed the older two were around seven or eight,<br> the youngest around Lilly’s age. Each of the <br>

    girls wore old fashion dresses that flowed loosely <br>from their bodies stopping at their tattered boots.<br> 

    The girl’s curly brown hair hung loosely<br> around their faces. Abby watches as Lilly motions <br>her visitors 

    to sit down beside her.<br>
    
    “I’m glad Lilly found someone to play with,”<br> she thinks, putting a bowl in the rinse water. <br>She starts

    scrubbing another dish when she hears<br> a voice behind her. Abby jumps, causing the plate <br>to slide out of her hands.<br>
    
    “I want you to meet my new friends, Mommy.<br> This is Amy, Ashley, and Anna. <br>They used to live here years ago.” Lilly says.<br>
    
    “Nice to meet you, girls,” Abby says, turning around.<br> She gasps when she sees their mutilated faces.<br>
    
    “Their daddy burnt them in a fire.<br> He burnt their mama too,” Lilly explains.<br>
    
    “How awful,” she says, <br>as the older child whisper in Lilly’s ear.<br>
    
    “I will, I will.”<br>
    
    “You will what Lilly?”<br>
    
    “The girls want me to tell you to stay out of the shed.”<br>
    
    “Why?”<br>
    
    “Mommy, Mommy come quick, daddy’s hurt.”<br>
    
    “Huh, what?” Abby wokeup as she hears Lilly screaming.<br>

    “Daddy is in the shed and he’s hurt!” <br>Throwing back the covers, Abby runs out of the house.<br> She 

    sees Greg slowly limping across the yard.<br>
    
    “Oh my god Greg, are you alright?”<br> she asks, running over to him.<br>
    
    “I’m fine. I just got the wind knocked out of me is all.”<br>
    
    “What happened, Greg?” He looks down at his daughter.<br>
    
    “Lilly, can you go check on Adam for me?”<br>
    
    “Sure daddy.” Greg waits until she’s<br> out of earshot before he continues.<br>
    
    “Someone pushed me off of the ladder.”<br>
    
    “Lilly would never do that to you?”<br>
    
    “It wasn’t Lilly.”<br>
    
    “If it wasn’t Lilly, then who? Wait,<br> you’re not saying a ghost pushed you, are you?”<br>
    
    “Mommy, Daddy, Adam’s crying.”<br>
    
    “I’m coming, honey.”<br>
    
    “I don’t know who it was.<br> All I know is someone pushed on my chest,<br> I lost my footing and fell,”<br>

    he explains as they continue walking to the house. <br>Seeing the landlord getting out of his truck they stop.<br>
    
    “Hi, Mr. Jones.” Greg says as the old man approaches them.<br>
    
    “Is everything working properly?”<br>
    
    “Everything is fine,” Greg says.<br>
    
    “I’d love to stay and chat, but I have a hungry <br>baby that needs tending to,” Abby explains.<br>
    
    “Don’t let me keep you. Well if you folks don’t <br>need anything else I’ll leave you two alone.”<br>
    
    “Wait, Mr. Jones!” Greg says, <br>grabbing a hold of his landlord’s arm.<br>
    
    “Yes.” He says, turning back around.<br>
    
    “I have a question, about the previous tenants.”<br>
    
    “They were only here a couple of weeks.”<br>
    
    “Why were they here for such a short time?”<br>
    
    “I don’t know. They moved out without saying a word.”<br>
    
    “Do you know where they are now?”<br>
    
    “Not a clue. Why are you so interested in them anyhow?”<br>
    
    “I found some of their stuff in the <br>barn and wanted to give it back to them.”<br>
    
    “That old junk was moved out of the<br> house long before they moved in.”<br>
    
    “Have you ever lived in the house?”<br>
    
    “No, I bought it for a rental property, <br>to make a little extra cash you see.”<br>
    
    “Who did you buy it from?”<br>
    
    “The bank, they sold it to me cheap said they <br>want to get out from under it. From what I<br>

    gather, they’ve been trying to sell it for years.”<br>
    
    “No one’s lived in the house during that time?”<br>
    
    “Not that I’m aware of. <br>Why are you so interested in the history anyhow?”<br>
    
    “Strange thinks have been happening to us.”<br>
    
    “Strange thinks like what?”<br>
    
    “Lilly swears she saw a man hanging<br> from the shed after that and I <br>felt someone push me off the ladder.”<br>
    
    “Well, you know how children’s imaginations<br> can run wild and as far as you<br>

    being pushed you probably just lost your footing.”<br>
    
    “I suppose you’re right. <br>I’m sorry I wasted your time with such foolishness.”<br>
    
    “No, don’t be. I just wish I could’ve been more<br> help. Well, I have farming to tend to,”<br>

    he says walking towards his truck.<br>
    
    “Thanks for checking on us.”<br>
    
    “No trouble at all.<br> If you ever need anything just holler.”<br>
    
    “I will and thanks again.” <br>He sees Abby busy in the kitchen when he <br>walks in the house.
    
    “The little burger ate fast,”<br> he laughs.
    
    “Adam wasn’t awake.”<br>
    
    “Why did Lilly say that he was?”<br>
    
    “She said she thought she heard him<br> crying when she walked in the house. <br>When I 

    checked on him, he was snoring away.”<br>
    
    “Maybe he was crying in his sleep. Where is Lilly?”<br>
    
    “She’s playing in her room, why?<br>
    
    “I wanted to show her the doll I found in the shed,” <br>he says, pulling the old rag doll out from behind him.<br>
    
    “She’ll love it.”<br>
    
    “That’s what I thought too,” <br>he says, running up the stairs. <br>Abby’s busily making supper 

    when <br>she feels someone brush up against her.<br>
    
    “Not, now, you sex maniac, you,” she laughs. <br>Spinning around, she sees that no one is behind her.<br>

    Hearing her husband walking down the <br>steps she turns towards the hallway.<br>
    
    “Was you in the kitchen a few seconds ago?”<br>
    
    “Not since I showed you the doll, why?”<br>
    
    “I swore someone just made a pass at me.”<br>
    
    “Maybe our ghost likes what he sees,” <br>he laughs, grabbing her butt.<br>
    
    “I’m being serious, Greg,” <br>she says, smacking his hand away.<br>
    
    “Ok, I’m sorry,” he snickers.<br>
    
    “A lot of strange thinks has happened to us today, Greg.”<br>
    
    “That’s for sure. You know what Lilly told me about the doll?”<br>
    
    “No, what?”<br>
    
    “She said that her new friend Anna <br>has been looking all over for it.<br> I swear that 

    child has one wild imagination.”<br>
    
    “Wait, did you just say Anna?”<br>
    
    “Yeah, she said she has three new friends.”<br>
    
    “Let me guess their names.<br> It’s Ashley, Anna, and Amy, right?”<br>
    
    “How did you know?”<br>
    
    “I had a dream about them.”<br>
    
    “A dream?”<br>
    
    “Yeah, I dreamed that Lilly introduced me to them. <br>She said that their daddy 

    killed them and their mamma in a fire.”<br>
    
    “Do you remember anything else about your dream?”<br>
    
    “They have dark brown hair, blue eyes and <br>they were dressed in clothes from the 70′s.”<br>
    
    “I’ll be right back.”<br>
    
    “What are you going to do?”<br>
    
    “I’m going to talk to Lilly about her new friends,” <br>he says, darting back up the stairs.<br>
    
    “Honey, the baby’s awake,” Greg yells.<br>
    
    “I hear him.” Walking in the nursery she <br>sees Adam is sleeping soundly in his bed.<br>
    
    “I know I heard you crying,” she says,<br> checking to make sure the baby is alright.<br>
    
    “I’ll get him.” <br>she hears as Greg steps in the nursery. <br>Seeing his wife standing 

    motionless over the crib,<br> he runs to her side.<br>
    
    “Is the baby alright?” he asks.<br>
    
    “He’s sound asleep.”<br>
    
    “I swore I heard him cry.”<br>
    
    “I did too.” Seeing the baby is sleeping <br>soundly they both walk out of the room.<br>
    
    “I’m going to talk to Lilly about her friends.”<br> Greg says, as he rushes off. <br>Abby is 

    putting the pot roast in the oven<br> when she sees her husband walking down the stairs.<br>

    She then notices the confused look on his face.<br>
    
    “What’s wrong honey?”<br>
    
    “I asked Lilly to tell me about her friends and <br>she repeated everything you just told me.”<br>
    
    “Maybe she overheard us talking?”<br>
    
    “How? She was in her room with the<br> door shut when I walked up the steps.”<br>
    
    “She could’ve heard us through the vents,” <br>she says, pointing above her.<br>
    
    “That’s possible I guess. <br>She did add one little detail.”<br>
    
    “What’s that?”<br>
    
    “She said that their daddy was hung in the barn.”<br>
    
    “She probably added that because of what she saw today.”<br>
    
    “Yeah, you’re probably right.”<br>
    
    “I think we’re letting our imagination get the best of us.”<br>
    
    “Me too,” Greg nervously laughs, glancing around the room.<br>

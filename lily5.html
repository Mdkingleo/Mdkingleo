     <h5>Chapter 5: The Cover Up</h5>
     <p>
Greg glances towards the phone again,<br> wishing his wife would call.<br> He hadn’t been able to reach<br> Abby all day and her long departure<br>

was starting to worry him.<br> I’m sure she’s just out<br> having fun, exploring the new<br> area,he reasons, trying to concentrate<br>

on the report. No matter how<br> hard he tried to make himself<br> believe it, an unsettling feeling <br>keeps gnawing at him, telling him differently.<br>

“I can’t take it anymore.<br>I just can’t!” he screams,<br> springing up from his desk.<br> His chair falls backward, clanking<br>

across the white tile floor.<br> Startled by the sudden noise his<br> secretary jumps in her seat.<br> Looking up she sees her boss<br>

pacing like a mad man<br> across the concrete floor.<br>

“You still can’t get a<br> hold of your wife?”<br>

“No, and I’ve tried for the<br> last four stinking hours.” <br>Glancing at his watch he <br>realizes it’s only been two.<br>

“I’m sure she’s fine, sir.”<br>

“I hope you’re right, Betty.”<br> Seeing the concerned look <br>on his face she continues.<br>

“I can have one of my cop <br>friends do a wellness check on her<br> if it’d make you feel any better.”<br>

“I’d sure appreciate it,” he says,<br> straightening up his overturned chair.<br>

“Let me see what I<br> can do.” She says reaching<br> for the phone.<br>

“I bet that’s her now,”<br> she says, scooping up the receiver.<br>

“Greg, the operator says you<br> have a call holding on line two.”<br> A stack of papers flies to<br> the floor as he reaches for the phone.<br>

“Are you alright Abby?”<br> Greg blurts into the receiver.<br>

“It’s awful, just awful, Greg”<br> she tearfully replies. Something<br> really did happen, he thinks, <br>plopping down in his chair.<br>

Seeing the terrified look<br> on her boss’s face, Betty<br> runs to his side.<br>

“Are you and the kids<br> alright?” Greg asks again.<br>

“We are but the house is<br> torn to shreds,” she cries.<br>

“Go somewhere safe and call the police.”<br>

“I already did.”<br>

“Where are you now?”<br>

“I’m at the house with the police.”<br>

“I’m on my way,” he says,<br> slamming the phone down in the cradle.<br>

“Is everything alright,<br> Mr. Jenkins?”<br>

“We’ve been burglarized,”<br> he states, running for the door.<br>

***<br>

“Whoever did this is long<br> gone by now,” Jerry says,<br> pulling a notebook out of his pocket.<br>

“Thank god,” Abby replies,<br> plopping down in the chair.<br>

“Do you know anyone who would<br> do this to you? Do you have any enemies,<br> disgruntled co-workers, neighbors?”<br>

“We don’t know anybody yet,<br> we just moved in a few days ago.”<br>

“Well, there doesn’t seem to be<br> anything missing. So If I had<br> to guess I’d say whoever did<br> this was looking for something.”<br>

“What?” she asks, waving her hands around.<br>

“You said that you just moved<br> in here a few days ago, correct?”<br>

“We moved in over the weekend, why?”<br>

“Maybe the old renters forgot something.”<br>

“Why did they have to destroy all<br> of our stuff looking for it?” <br>she cries, scanning the cluttered mess.<br>

“Abby, oh thank god you’re alright,”<br> Greg replies, running into the house.<br> Jerry holds up his hand to stop him.<br>

“You are?”<br>

“Her husband, Greg Jenkins.”<br>

“Do you live here?”<br>

“Yes, me, my wife and our two kids.<br> Where’s the kids, where’s Lilly<br> and Adam?” he asks, anxiously looking around.<br>

“They’re asleep in the van.”<br>

“Good,” he says, plopping down beside her.<br>

“I was telling your wife that<br>we believe whoever did this was<br> looking for something. Since<br> there doesn’t seem to be any<br>

forced entry and the front door<br> and windows are locked, they<br>must have entered from the back door.<br> So either they have a key or you<br>

forgot to lock up.”<br>

“No, I remember locking the door.<br>In fact, I locked the door and the deadbolt.<br> See, our landlord had one of<br> his workers come out to do<br> a little yard work, and he<br> looked a little shady so<br>I made sure I locked up,”<br> she quickly explains.<br>

“Was he still here when you left?”<br>

“Yes, he was getting equipment <br>from the back of his truck when<br> I pulled out of the drive.”<br>

“Do you remember the guy’s name?”<br>

“He said his name is Randy.”<br>

“Can you describe him?”<br>

“He’s short around five four,<br> five-five, heavy set.<br> He has short brown hair and brown eyes.”<br>

“We’ll look into it.<br> In the meantime, I’d<br> advise you to change the locks.”<br>

“We will officer, thank you,”<br> Greg replies, wrapping his arms<br> around his trembling wife.<br>

“Why are the police here,<br> mommy? Daddy,” Lilly says,<br> running to her father.<br>

“Someone came in and threw our stuff <br>all over the place. So the police<br> are here to find out who did it.<br> Abby explains.<br>

“I know who did it, Mommy,<br> it was a guy named Mike.<br> He’s looking for Suzanne’s diary.”<br>

“How do you know that, princess?”<br>

“My friends told me.<br> They told me to tell Mommy<br> that she forgot to lock the door.”<br>

“No, I remember locking it.<br> Wait, no I didn’t. I was going<br> to go back and lock it but<br> the guy had me so spooked I <br>completely forgot.”<br>

“He had you spooked?”<br>

“Yeah, he looks kind of creepy<br> and there is something about him<br> that I just didn’t like,” she says,<br> trying to recall the encounter.<br>

“Did he do anything to you?”<br>

“No, no he just gave off a bad<br> vibe is all. It might have been <br>the way he stood or how he spoke,<br> I don’t know for sure.<br> Do you think we should tell<br> 

the police who did it?”<br>

“Sure and when they ask how we know we can <br>tell them that Lilly’s dead friends told us.”<br>

“Yeah, you’re probably right. <br>Why would he be looking for the diary and<br> how did he know I found it in the first place?”<br>

“Who else knows about the diary?”<br>

“Just you, me and Lilly.<br> Wait, I told the librarian too.”<br>

“So maybe she’s the one who told Mike.”<br>

“Why would Janet do that?” Abby asks, puzzled.<br>

“Where’s the diary now?”<br>

“I took it to town with me so I can look up a few names. <br>That’s it, that’s why he wants it.”<br>

Pulling the book out of her purse, <br>she flips through the pages. <br>“Suzanne wrote that a few people threatened Jack, <br>

and Mike is on the list,” she explains.<br>

“So, maybe Mike is afraid that something <br>in the diary will tie him to Jack’s...<br>” Remembering his daughter is still in the room he stops.<br>

“Lilly, could you check on Adam for me, please?”<br>

“Sure Daddy.” <br>Seeing Lilly walk out the door he continues.<br>

“Tie him to Jack’s death.”<br>

“The librarian said that Jack hung<br> himself after his wife fled with the girls.<br>

“What if he didn’t hang himself?<br> What if he was murdered?”<br>

“That would explain why everyone acts<br> so strange when we ask about the house.”<br>

“It’d also explain the neighbor’s warning,” he concludes.<br>

“If the librarian told Mike I found the diary<br>that means Janet is in on it too.”<br>Her thoughts drifted back to her original<br>

conclusion about how Jack killed his <br>family and the town folk killed him.<br>

“I wonder how many others are covering<br> this thing up.” Greg says.<br>

“You know the cop didn’t seem overly <br>concerned about the break-in. <br>They searched the house to make sure the intruder is gone, <br>

but that’s about all they did.”<br>

“So you think that the police <br>are a part of the cover-up too?”<br>

“Maybe.”<br>

“Mommy, Adam is awake.”<br>

“What do you have there, Princess?”<br> Taking a piece of notebook paper out <br>of the child’s hand he quickly unfolds it. <br>

He sees the message is written in bold letters <br>with red ink dripping off the sides.<br>A puddle of red ink lay directly below the message.<br>

“Where did you get this?”<br>

“In the van,” she explains.”<br>

“What does it say, Greg?”<br>

“Leave it alone,” he says, handing it to Abby.<br>

“Oh my god the baby,” Abby exclaims,<br> rushing through the door. <br>She hears Adam screaming as she runs towards the van.<br>

Unbuckling the car seat, <br>she quickly scoops him up.<br>

“Is he alright?” Greg asks.<br>

“I think so,” she says,<br> assessing the screaming infant.<br>

“Look, mommy, another note.” <br>Lilly rips a piece of paper loose<br> from the back of the car seat.<br> Abby snatches it out of her hands.<br>

“What does it say, honey?”<br>

“Watch your back.”<br>

“Get in the house, now!” Greg yells,<br> hustling his family inside.<br>

“What are we going to do?” she asks,<br> watching him lock the door.<br>

“I don’t know,” he says, nervously glancing around.<br>

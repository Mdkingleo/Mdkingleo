     <h5>Chapter 3: <br> Uninvited Guest</h5>
     <p>
      “Honey, I’m home,” Greg announces,  <br>stepping into the house. <br>He feels an unnerving stillness hovering all<br>
      
      around him the moment he closes the door.<br> It was like an unsettling feeling <br>of doom was lurking closely about. <br>
      
      Shivering, Greg continues <br>through the dark eerie house.<br>
      
      “Abby, Lilly,” he yells.<br> Hearing her daddy’s voice echoing through the house, <br>Lilly runs to the edge of the stairs.<br>
      
      “Daddy, Daddy!”<br>
      
      “What is it pumpkin?”<br>
      
      “Mommy is in the attic and she’s hurt.”<br> Racing to the top of the stairs, <br>Greg scoops the terrified child into his arms. <br>
      
      Halfway down the corridor, the two sees <br>Abby slowly climbing down the wooden stairs.<br>
      
      “Lilly said you’re hurt.”<br>
      
      “No, no, I’m alright.” She laughs,<br> carefully climbing down the remaining steps.<br>
      
      “Why did you scream, Mommy?”<br>
      
      “I saw my shadow on the wall,” she chuckles, <br>stepping off of the ladder.<br>
      
      “You nearly scared me to death young lady,” <br>Lilly exclaims, wagging her finger at her.<br>
      
      “I promise to never scare you again, Princess Lilly.”<br>
      
      “You better not!” Turning on her heals<br> the child stomps towards her room. <br>Her parents laugh.<br>
      
      “I guess she told you.”<br>
      
      “I guess so.”<br>
      
      “What’s that?” Greg asks, <br>eyeing the black object in her hand.<br>
      
      “I found this on the floor. <br>It was lying away from the stuff <br>like someone wanted me to find it.” <br>
      
      Handing it to him she continues.<br>
      
      “It looks like someone’s old diary. <br>An expensive old diary,” he corrects,<br> eyeing the leather cover and its sturdy binders.<br>
      
      Opening it up, he sees the yellowing<br> pages full of scribbly child-like writing.<br>
      
      “It’s Suzanne’s,” Lilly says, <br>walking back down the hall.<br>
      
      “Who’s Suzanne, honey?”<br>
      
      “She’s the girl’s mommy.<br> She told me she wanted you to find it so<br> you can understand what happened to them, <br>
      
      why they don’t want us to go in the barn.”<br>
      
      “Is Suzanne your pretend friend too?”<br>
      
      “No Daddy, she’s real just <br>like Ashley, Amy, and Anna.”<br>
      
      “No honey, the girls are imaginary<br> because you can’t see them.”<br>
      
      “I can see them just fine.<br> In fact, they’re standing right beside you,” <br>she giggles, pointing to his left side. <br>
      
      He quickly steps to the right.<br>
      
      “Don’t worry Daddy, they won’t hurt us,” <br>the child giggles again.<br>
      
      “That is enough of your story telling, Lilly!”<br>
      
      “I’m not telling stories, Daddy, honest.”<br>
      
      “Go to your room right now!” <br>He orders, pointing down the hall.<br>
      
      “They’re right grownups just don’t understand,”<br> she says, stomping down the hallway.<br>
      
      “I had a dream about this book,” Abby says,<br> glancing at the weathered object in her hands.<br>
      
      “The same dream you told me about yesterday?”<br>
      
      “No, a different dream,<br> I dreamed a woman dropped it as<br> she’s being thrown into a fire.”<br>
      
      “You dreamed that a woman was tossed in a fire?”<br>
      
      “I dreamed that a short,<br> stocky, man threw her and two small <br>children into a blazing fire and <br>I couldn’t do anything to stop him.”<br>
      
      “That must have been one hell of a dream, honey.”<br>
      
      “It was awful, just awful, Greg.<br> I’m so glad Adam woke me up when he did.”<br>
      
      “So what do you plan to do with the book?”<br>
      
      “Read it of course.”<br>
      
      “It might give you nightmares.”<br>
      
      “They can’t be any worse than the ones <br>I’m, already having,” she says, <br>walking towards the steps.<br>
      
      “A strange thing happened to me at work today.”<br>
      
      “What’s that?”<br>
      
      “I overheard two people talking about the last renters. <br>I ran out in the hall hoping to talk to them, <br>but they already left.”<br>
      
      “What did they say?”<br>
      
      “They said they hope what happened <br>to them doesn’t happen to us too.”<br>
      
      “Did they say what it was?”<br>
      
      “No, but by the tone of their voices,<br> I knew it couldn’t have been good.<br> When I asked a couple of coworkers about<br>
      
      the house they said they didn’t<br> know anything about the place.<br> I knew by the way they acting,<br>
      
      they weren’t telling me the truth.”<br>
      
      “Why would they lie about <br>something like that?” she questions.<br>
      
      “Maybe they’re hiding something.”<br>
      
      “What?”<br>
      
      “I have no idea.”<br>
      
      “One of our neighbors stopped by today.”<br> She says, wiping the dust off of the small table.<br>
      
      “That’s nice.”<br>
      
      “Yeah, maybe,” she says smacking <br>the dust off of her clothes.<br>
      
      “Why, didn’t you like her?”<br>
      
      “She’s alright, I guess.”<br>
      
      “So what’s the problem?”<br>
      
      “It was the way she acted?”<br>
      
      “Was she strung out on drugs or something?”<br>
      
      “No, no, it’s nothing like that.<br> She didn’t want to come in the house at first.<br> When she did, she acted real<br>
      
      jittery like she was expecting <br>something to jump out at her. <br>When I asked her about the house,<br>
      
      she said she didn’t know anything and<br> said it’d be wise if I didn’t look into <br>it either then bolted out the door.”<br>
      
      “I wonder what’s happened here,” Greg says. <br>Feeling the eerie sensation coming back, <br>he shivers as he heads towards the steps.<br>
      
      “Hopefully, this book will tell us something,” <br>she says, following after him. <br>Turning to the first page she continues.<br>
      
      “Maybe Lilly’s friends know what’s going on.”<br>
      
      “You believe her?”<br>
      
      “I’m starting to,”<br> she hands him the book.<br> Suzanne’s Diary is handwritten on the first page.<br>
      
      “Lilly, come here please,” Greg orders.<br>
      
      “What is it, daddy?”<br>
      
      “Your friends Amy, Ashley, Suzanne and.”<br>
      
      “Her name is Anna daddy.”<br>
      
      “Yes, Anna. You said they use to live here?”<br>
      
      “They did until their Daddy killed them.”<br>
      
      “How did they die?”<br>
      
      “I already told you.”<br>
      
      “Tell me again.”<br>
      
      “Their Daddy killed them in a fire.”<br>
      
      “Where is their Daddy now?”<br>
      
      “He’s in the shed.”<br>
      
      “The shed?”<br>
      
      “Suzanne won’t let him in the house.”<br>
      
      “Why is that?”<br>
      
      “He’s a bad, bad man Daddy. <br>That’s why they don’t want you to go in there.”<br>
      
      “So he’s dead, too?”<br>
      
      “Yes.”<br>
      
      “How did he die?”<br>
      
      “A few neighbors hung him in the shed.<br> Can I go play now?”<br>
      
      “One more question and you can go.”<br>
      
      “What,” she says, stomping her foot.<br>
      
      “The girls aren’t going to hurt us, are they?”<br>
      
      “Of course not, Daddy.” Lilly laughs<br>
      
      “They aren’t going to start throwing <br>stuff, knocking pictures over <br>or anything like that, are they?”<br>
      
      “You’ve been watching too much TV,<br> Daddy.” the child laughs again.<br>
      
      “I have been watching a lot <br>of scary shows,” he chuckles.<br>
      
      “Can I go now?”<br>
      
      “Yes, honey.”<br> Grabbing the rag doll off the antique rocker, <br>the child rushes back to her room.<br>
      
      “I don’t know if I want to stay here,<br> knowing about our five ghosts, Greg,” she says. <br>Clinging onto her husband, <br>
      
      she anxiously starts looking around.<br>
      
      “Where do you suggest we go?”<br>
      
      “Anywhere but here,” she says, <br>scooting closer to him.<br> Hearing Lilly’s door open they both look down the hall.<br>
      
      “Mommy, daddy they don’t want you to go.”<br>
      
      “Who honey?”<br>
      
      “My friends, they said they like us living <br>here and don’t want us to leave.” <br>Abby and Greg glanced at each other,<br>
      
      a horrified look on their faces.<br>
      
      “They promised not to hurt us if<br> we stay,” the child continues.<br>
      
      “Now I’m really spooked, Greg.”<br>
      
      “Tell your friend’s we’ll<br> stay as long as they behave.”<br>
      
      “Greg!” He looks over at Abby and winks.<br>
      
      “They heard you, daddy,” she says, <br>running to her room.”<br>
      
      “I have something to show you in the car,”<br> he says pulling Abby down the stairs.<br>
      
      When they’re both safely settled <br>in the van he continues.<br>
      
      “I’ll start asking about <br>another house tomorrow, alright?”<br>
      
      “I’ll see what I can find in the paper.” <br>Suddenly the large metal door slams shut.<br>
      
      “Guess they can hear us out here too,” <br>Greg wearily replies. <br>The garage door opens and closes again.<br>
      
      “I guess so.”<br>
      
      ******************<br>
      
      Mr. Jones is working in the field when he<br> sees a red pickup pull into the drive.<br>
      
      “What does that lame brain want now,” he asks.<br> Wiping the sweat off of his forehead <br>he starts walking towards the house.<br>
      
      “I heard you got some new renters.” <br>The brawny man begins.<br>
      
      “A young couple with two little<br> kids moved in over the weekend.”<br>
      
      “They’re not going to be a problem are they?”<br>
      
      “No.”<br>
      
      “They better not be,” he warns.<br>
      
      “They won’t be,” he says, <br>wiping his forehead again.<br>
      
      “Good, because I’d hate to do to them what<br> I had to do to your last noisy renters.”<br>
      
      “Now don’t you go causing the<br> Jenkins any trouble,” he warns.<br>
      
      “I’ll leave them alone as long as they <br>don’t go asking a bunch of questions.”<br> Jumping in his truck he speeds out of the driveway.<br>
      
      “Maybe I should go talk to them,<br> stop the situation before it begins,” Ed thinks, <br>walking back towards the field.<br>
      
      ******************<br>

      Walking in the bedroom Greg sees his wife propped <br>comfortably against her two favorite green pillows. <br>
      
      She had another smaller pillow underneath her feet. <br>He starts undressing as he walks over to the closet.<br>
      
      Abby insisted he add on so they’d<br> both have room for their things.<br> Even with the added space, Abby’s stuff <br>
      
      still manages to make its way over to his side.<br> What am I going to do with her? He thinks,<br>
      
      moving her stuff back over to her cluttered side.<br>
      
      “You’re still reading that thing?” <br>Greg asks eyeing the leather book in her hands.<br>
      
      “I’m almost finished.” <br>Reading the last paragraph, she closes the book.<br>
      
      “It must have been interesting<br> for you to finish it that fast.<br>
      
      “You wouldn’t believe half the stuff he did to her,<br> Greg,” she says sitting on the side of the bed.<br>
      
      “He’s that bad huh?<br>
      
      “Worse than you can possibly imagine,” she says,<br> waving her hands around. <br>Something she often does when she’s upset.<br>
      
      “Lilly’s right, Jack is an evil, evil man.<br> All of the horrible things he did to his wife. <br>He even raped his little girls. <br>
      
      I wish Suzanne had castrated him <br>when she had the chance.”<br>
      
      “Honey,” he exclaims, covering his privates.<br>
      
      “The bastard deserved it, Greg. <br>He deserves that and a lot more! <br>He’d screw anything with two legs. <br>
      
      The rare occasions he did come home, <br>he’d beat and torture his family. <br>The town’s people got wind of his abuse<br>
      
      and threatened to kill him, but only one <br>had enough balls to do anything about it.”<br>
      
      “What did he do?”<br>
      
      “George shot him in the nuts for sleeping with his wife.”<br>
      
      “I bet that curbed Jack’s appetite for a while.”<br>
      
      “It only made him meaner, more promiscuous.”<br>
      
      “Maybe one of the others finally carried out their threat.”<br>
      
      “I wouldn’t doubt it,” she says,<br> laying the book on the nightstand beside her.<br>
      
      “No one should ever have to live through the hell that Suzanne<br> and her girls did. No one! She sobs into Greg’s chest.<br>
      
      “She’s in a much better place, honey,” he soothingly replies<br> wrapping his arms around her.<br>
      
      “I know, but she still didn’t <br>deserve to be treated that way.<br> I’m so lucky to have you,” <br>
      
      she blubbers cuddling into Greg’s loving arms.<br>
      
      “And I’m lucky to have you,” <br>he says kissing her forehead.<br>
      
      “Suzanne was an orphan, <br>living on the streets when they met.”<br> She says wiping her tears away.<br> 
      
      “Really?”<br>
      
      “Yeah, she thought he was her knight <br>and shining armor coming to <br>rescue her from the cruel world.”<br>
      
      “Some prince he turned out to be.”<br>
      
      “Her prince charming turned out <br>to be the prince of horror. <br>You know what I hope?” she asks,<br> sitting back up.<br>
      
      “What’s that, honey?”<br>
      
      “I hope that whoever killed him <br>made him suffer a long time for <br>what he did to his family.”<br>
      
      “I’m sure they did.”<br>
      
      ***************<br>
      
      Ed has been thinking about the<br> new renters all day long.<br> He assured the gang that the new <br>tenants wouldn’t give them trouble, <br>
      
      but he’d thought that about the last renters too.<br>
      
      If the group hadn’t made them disappear<br> when they did, it’s hard telling what<br> kind of chaos they would’ve started. <br>
      
      All the questions they were asking,<br> digging in the past, putting their <br>noses in places that it didn’t belong.<br>
      
      Those damned hard headed city slickers <br>just can’t leave well enough alone. <br>It’s like they purposely come down here with<br>
      
      their highfalutin ways just to stir up shit!<br> I bet these guys will be just like them too. <br>
      
      They’re already asking about the last tenants.<br> So I figure it’s only a matter of time<br> before they start asking around town. <br>
      
      God knows what else they’ll ask or who <br>they’ll ask in the near future. <br>Maybe If I scare them bad enough,<br>
      
      they’ll be too afraid ask anything else. <br>Yeah, that’s what I’ll do, <br>I’ll put the fear of god in them, <br>
      
      and if my tactics don’t frighten them, <br>then I’ll warn the others. <br>Now I have to figure out what would<br> terrify them the most.<br>
      
      Sitting down with a pen and paper, <br>he began scribbling a few ideas.<br>
      
      “What if I do a combination back to back,” <br>he thinks, grouping ideas together. <br>Suddenly another thought came to mind.<br>
      
      “That’d scare the shit out of me.”<br> laughing he jots it down.  <br>
